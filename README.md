## Tensorflow

Installed Tensorflow locally using the Anaconda, Python 2.7 instructions.

```
# Creating the environment through a conda command
$ conda create -n tensorflow python=2.7

# Activate the environment. This causes the terminal prompt to change.
$ source activate tensorflow
(tensorflow)$ # The new prompt for the conda environment

# Installing tensorflow.
$ conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow

# Deactivate the environment to return to the usual prompt.
(tensorflow)$ source deactivate
$ # Back to normal
```
